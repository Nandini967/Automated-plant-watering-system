<h1 align="center">AUTOMATED PLANT WATERING SYSTEM</h1>
<p align="center">An autonomous plant watering system that uses sensors, machine learning, and automated controls to monitor soil moisture, identify plant types, and dispense water efficiently based on plant-specific needs..</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
  Traditional plant care often involves manual monitoring of soil moisture and environmental conditions, which can be time-consuming and inconsistent. Over-watering or under-watering plants is a common problem, leading to poor plant health and wasted resources. Many people struggle to provide the right amount of water, especially those with busy schedules or limited gardening knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Our Automated Plant Watering System addresses this problem by automating the entire watering process, ensuring that plants receive the precise amount of water they need, based on real-time environmental data. The system leverages a machine learning (ML) model to predict the water requirements of plants. This ML model, which runs on a Raspberry Pi, takes inputs such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity readings to determine the optimal watering amount.
</p>
<p>
The system is designed with Arduino controlling the watering mechanism. Various sensors are used to monitor the soil moisture and environmental conditions, and Arduino communicates with the Raspberry Pi to obtain the predicted water amount from the model. Based on this prediction, Arduino manages the water pump to dispense the right amount of water, ensuring efficient plant care with minimal manual intervention. The integration of Raspberry Pi and Arduino allows seamless communication between the sensors and the watering system, making it a fully automated solution for plant care.
